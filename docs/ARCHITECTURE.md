# System Architecture — Janki Rasoi Tiffin Ordering Platform

**Status:** Active Architectural Baseline  
**Scope:** Customer Web Storefront, Admin Management Panel, Rider Web App, NestJS REST API, Background Worker, and Data Stores.  
**Target Infrastructure:** Vercel (Next.js Frontend) & Render Singapore (NestJS API, PostgreSQL, Outbox Worker).

---

## 1. Executive System Overview

Janki Rasoi is a production-grade tiffin and scheduled meal ordering service. The architecture is designed around three primary user touchpoints connected to a centralized, transaction-safe backend:

1. **Customer Web Storefront (`apps/web/(store)`)**: Public-facing, responsive web application for browsing daily/weekly menus, configuring portion variants and add-ons, validating delivery slots/pincodes, guest checkout with Razorpay, and tokenized real-time order tracking.
2. **Admin Management Panel (`apps/web/(admin)`)**: Kitchen operations hub for order lifecycle management (Accept -> Prepare -> Dispatch), dynamic catalog availability, delivery slot capacity planning, rider assignment, refunds, and append-only audit logging.
3. **Rider Web Application (`apps/web/(rider)`)**: Mobile-first, lightweight PWA-compatible browser interface for delivery personnel to view active assignments, launch Google Maps navigation, trigger customer OTP generation, submit verified 6-digit delivery OTPs, or report delivery exceptions.
4. **Core Backend Engine (`apps/api`)**: Modular NestJS application enforcing server-authoritative pricing in integer paise, transactional state machines, Razorpay signature and webhook verification, HMAC-SHA256 OTP management, and audit logging.
5. **Background Asynchronous Worker (`apps/api/src/worker.ts`)**: Render background worker polling a PostgreSQL transactional outbox (`SKIP LOCKED`) for decoupled, resilient execution of SMS notifications, webhook processing, external image indexing, and auto-cancellations.

## 3. Data Flow & Sequence Architecture

### 3.1. Authoritative Checkout & Payment Workflow

To prevent client tampering and race conditions on slot capacity, the frontend is strictly treated as untrusted:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor Customer as Customer Browser
    participant API as NestJS API
    participant DB as PostgreSQL
    participant RZP as Razorpay Gateway

    Customer->>API: POST /api/v1/checkout/quote (items, slot_id, pincode)
    API->>DB: Query Catalog Prices, Slot Capacity & Zone Eligibility
    DB-->>API: Active Prices & Available Capacity
    API->>API: Server-side recalculation of Subtotal, Delivery Fee, Taxes (Paise)
    API-->>Customer: Validated Quote (Quote Token, Total Amount in Paise)

    Customer->>API: POST /api/v1/checkout/orders (Quote Token, Delivery Details, Idempotency-Key)
    API->>DB: BEGIN Transaction
    API->>DB: Lock & Increment Slot Capacity Reservation
    API->>DB: Create Order Record (Status: AWAITING_PAYMENT)
    API->>DB: Create PaymentAttempt Record (Status: PENDING)
    API->>RZP: POST /v1/orders (amount: totalPaise, currency: "INR", receipt: orderId)
    RZP-->>API: Razorpay Order ID (order_xyz123)
    API->>DB: Update PaymentAttempt with provider_order_id
    API->>DB: COMMIT Transaction
    API-->>Customer: 201 Created (order_id, razorpay_order_id, amount_paise, tracking_token)

    Customer->>RZP: Open Razorpay Standard Checkout Modal
    Customer->>RZP: Authorize Payment via UPI / Card / NetBanking
    RZP-->>Customer: Razorpay Response (payment_id, order_id, signature)

    Customer->>API: POST /api/v1/payments/verify (order_id, razorpay_payment_id, razorpay_signature)
    API->>API: HMAC-SHA256 Verification with RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET
    alt Signature Valid
        API->>DB: Update PaymentAttempt (Status: CAPTURED)
        API->>DB: Transition Order (Status: PLACED)
        API->>DB: Enqueue Order Confirmation SMS in Outbox
        API-->>Customer: 200 OK (Status: PLACED, tracking_url)
    else Signature Invalid
        API-->>Customer: 400 Bad Request (Payment verification failed)
    end

    Note over RZP,API: Webhook Fallback in case Customer Closes Browser
    RZP->>API: POST /api/v1/webhooks/razorpay (event: payment.captured, signature)
    API->>API: Verify Raw Body HMAC Signature
    API->>DB: Idempotent Payment Reconciliation & State Transition
```

### 3.2. Rider Delivery & 6-Digit Cryptographic OTP Flow

To guarantee food handover without rider self-approval or SMS sniffing:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor Admin as Admin / Kitchen
    actor Rider as Rider Web Panel
    actor Customer as Delivery Customer
    participant API as NestJS API
    participant DB as PostgreSQL
    participant Worker as Outbox Worker
    participant SMS as MSG91 DLT Gateway

    Admin->>API: PATCH /api/v1/admin/orders/:id/assign-rider (rider_id)
    API->>DB: Create RiderAssignment (Status: ASSIGNED)
    API-->>Admin: Assigned Successfully

    Rider->>API: PATCH /api/v1/rider/deliveries/:id/out-for-delivery
    API->>API: Generate Cryptographic 6-digit OTP (e.g. 583921)
    API->>API: Compute HMAC-SHA256(OTP, SERVER_SECRET)
    API->>DB: Insert DeliveryOtp record (hashed_verifier, max_attempts=5, expires_at=+2h)
    API->>DB: Update Order Status -> OUT_FOR_DELIVERY
    API->>DB: Insert OutboxMessage (SEND_DELIVERY_OTP, phone, masked_order_id)
    API-->>Rider: 200 OK (Status: OUT_FOR_DELIVERY, navigation_coords)

    Worker->>DB: Poll Outbox (SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED)
    Worker->>SMS: Send Template SMS with DLT Header: "Your Janki Rasoi OTP is 583921"
    SMS-->>Customer: SMS Delivered to Phone

    Rider->>Customer: Arrives at Doorstep
    Customer-->>Rider: Verbally Provides OTP
    Rider->>API: POST /api/v1/rider/deliveries/:id/verify-otp (code: "583921")
    API->>DB: Fetch Active DeliveryOtp for Rider & Order
    API->>API: Check Expiration & Failed Attempt Threshold (< 5)
    API->>API: Compare HMAC(submitted_code) === stored_hashed_verifier
    alt OTP Valid
        API->>DB: BEGIN Transaction
        API->>DB: Mark DeliveryOtp as USED
        API->>DB: Update Order Status -> DELIVERED
        API->>DB: Record DeliveryAttempt (Status: SUCCESS)
        API->>DB: Enqueue Delivery Completed SMS in Outbox
        API->>DB: COMMIT Transaction
        API-->>Rider: 200 OK (Delivery Completed)
    else OTP Invalid
        API->>DB: Increment failed_attempts
        API-->>Rider: 400 Bad Request ("Invalid OTP. 3 attempts remaining.")
    end
```

## 5. Security Architecture & Threat Mitigations

### 5.1. Authentication & Session Management
- **Customer:** Anonymous / Guest checkout is first-class. Orders are tracked via high-entropy `tracking_token` (UUIDv4/NanoID) returned at checkout.
- **Admin & Rider:** Authenticated via email/password or phone/password.
- **Session Tokens:** Issued as `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Lax` cookies. No access tokens in browser `localStorage`.
- **RBAC Enforcement:** NestJS `@Roles('ADMIN', 'STAFF', 'RIDER')` guards applied at the controller and route level. UI visibility is cosmetic; server endpoints reject unauthorized requests unconditionally.

### 5.2. Financial Integrity (Integer Paise)
- Floating-point representations (`float`, `double`) are banned for monetary values across the entire stack.
- All amounts are computed, transmitted, and persisted as 64-bit integer paise (`100 paise = 1 INR`).
- Taxes, delivery surcharges, packaging fees, and discounts are recomputed by the server inside DB transactions. Client-submitted prices are discarded.

### 5.3. Webhook Security & Idempotency
- Razorpay webhook payloads are read as raw buffer streams for SHA256 signature verification before JSON deserialization.
- Every incoming webhook event ID (`event.id`) is recorded in the `PaymentEvent` table with a unique constraint. Duplicate webhook deliveries exit with `200 OK` without triggering duplicate state transitions.

### 5.4. Delivery OTP Protection (OWASP Compliance)
- Delivery OTPs are never stored in plaintext in the database; only a salted HMAC verifier is retained.
- OTPs are never returned in any API response to the rider or admin.
- Locked after 5 consecutive incorrect submissions.
- Hard expiration of 2 hours or the end of the delivery slot window.
- If an order is reassigned to another rider, existing active OTP records are immediately revoked.
- Administrative manual bypass requires an explicit `REASON` text and creates an immutable entry in the `AuditLog`.
